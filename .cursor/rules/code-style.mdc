# Code Style

<ALWAYS: DRY/>

- **Variable names:** Clear and descriptive (never `data`, `result`, `temp`)
- **Functions:** Extract reusable logic, max 50 lines
- **Components:** Functional components with hooks
- **Types:** Full TypeScript coverage for all new code
- **Schema:** Always stored in `/schema.prisma`
